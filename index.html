            <h2>September and October</h2>
            <p>September 23rd is when we officially met! We then went on a not awkward ice cream date and also then got
                pizza at Oakledge Park the following friday. In october we went on a fun hike (we went the wrong way though).
                We also made apple cider doughnuts and celebrated Halloween together (jack hated the indiana jones girl).

            <p> Some cool dates we had: making pizzas together, throwing up together (I was just being a nice guy and decided to throw up with you)
                drinking mind erasers with your roommates, making gingerbread houses together and cookies together!

            <h2>January-February</h2>
            <p>We started off January by spending a great week together! We skiied (I'm better than you I've decided),
                 Went out to eat at Pascolos, made your family's famous shrimp pasta dish together, went on a run together and then 
                 you forced me against my will to go into lake champlain. Then I got to spend another night with you after a winter storm 
                 and I gave you a mini tour of Scituate and Norwell. And we've been facetiming a lot!
